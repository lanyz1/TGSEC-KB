## Gate 0 Validation

Before writing the report, confirm all three:

**1. What can the attacker DO right now?**
You must be able to demonstrate one of: execute `id`/`whoami` and capture the output, make a DNS/HTTP callback from the target server to your controlled host, write a file to the filesystem, or read `/etc/passwd`. "Might be able to" fails this gate.

**2. What does the victim LOSE?**
Articulate the concrete impact: source code exfiltration, credential theft (database, API keys, cloud IAM), lateral movement to internal network, supply chain compromise of downstream users, data destruction. Generic "attacker gains RCE" fails — name the crown jewels at risk.

**3. Can it be reproduced in 10 minutes from scratch?**
Write the reproduction steps before submitting. If you need more than: (a) a Burp request, (b) a payload file, and (c) a listener — simplify it. If reproduction requires a specific race condition, timing, or ephemeral state, document the exact conditions. Triagers who can't reproduce in one attempt will downgrade or close the report.
