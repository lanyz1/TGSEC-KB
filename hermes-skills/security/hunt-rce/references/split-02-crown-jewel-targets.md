## Crown Jewel Targets

RCE vulnerabilities command the highest payouts in bug bounty programs because they grant attackers direct execution control over target infrastructure. The highest-value targets are:

**Highest-paying asset types:**
- **Enterprise server products** (GitHub Enterprise Server, self-hosted GitLab) — privilege escalation chains from low-privileged console roles to root SSH access consistently pay critical/high
- **Supply chain / package registries** — dependency confusion attacks against npm, PyPI, etc. hit critical severity across every major program
- **Cloud-native infrastructure** — exposed Kubernetes API servers, ingress controllers, and misconfiqured CI/CD pipelines
- **Mobile app backends and OAuth flows** — where server-side processing of attacker-controlled data meets execution contexts
- **Admin/management consoles** — template injection in configuration panels reaches root with a single payload

**Why this class pays most:**
- Blast radius is infrastructure-wide, not user-scoped
- Proof-of-concept is unambiguous — shell output is undeniable
- Fix requires architectural changes, not just a patch
- Programs cannot afford false negatives on RCE
