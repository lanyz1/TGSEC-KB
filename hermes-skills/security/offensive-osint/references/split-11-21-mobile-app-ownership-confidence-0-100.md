## 21. Mobile App Ownership Confidence — 0–100 rubric

Before running deep APK static analysis, score whether the discovered app actually belongs to the target. Threshold: **≥70 = accept**.

| Signal | Points |
|---|---|
| Package reverse-DNS matches target domain (e.g., `com.acme.android` ⟂ `acme.com`) | +40 |
| Developer email is `<anything>@<target-domain>` | +25 |
| Developer website URL is the target domain (or a confirmed sibling brand domain) | +20 |
| App name contains a brand keyword from operator-supplied brand list | +10 |
| App has ≥ minimum review-score threshold (default 20 reviews) | +5 |

Apps below threshold are tagged `mobile_review_pending` and shown but not analyzed. Operator can re-score with `--mobile-ownership-threshold 50` for noisier collection.
