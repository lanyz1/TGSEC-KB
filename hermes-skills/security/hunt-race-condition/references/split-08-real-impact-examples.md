## Real Impact Examples

### Scenario 1: Social Platform Vote Manipulation
A bug bounty platform's "popular reports" feature allowed upvotes to improve report visibility and researcher reputation scores. By sending ~15 parallel upvote requests for the same report using a single HTTP/2 connection (single-packet attack), a researcher was able to register 10–15 votes from a single account. This allowed artificial inflation of report rankings, manipulation of researcher reputation scores, and distortion of the platform's crowdsourced prioritization system — directly undermining trust in the platform's core feature for triaging vulnerability reports.

### Scenario 2: Major Social Network — Duplicate Promotional Actions
On a major social network (Facebook-scale), promotional or limited-use actions — such as adding a phone number for a one-time security credit, or claiming a one-time bonus — were vulnerable to simultaneous parallel requests. An attacker could race the claim endpoint and receive the promotional benefit multiple times, causing direct financial loss to the platform and allowing fraudulent accumulation of platform currency or benefits at scale. Given the user volume, even a brief window before patching represented significant financial exposure.

### Scenario 3: Cloud Infrastructure Provider — Resource Limit Bypass
A cloud hosting provider enforced limits on the number of resources (e.g., droplets, projects, or API keys) a free-tier user could create. The limit check and resource creation were non-atomic operations. By racing the creation endpoint with 20 simultaneous requests, an attacker bypassed the enforcement logic and created resources far exceeding their tier limit. This translated directly to unauthorized compute consumption, billing fraud, and abuse of infrastructure — impacting both the provider's revenue and system stability for legitimate users.
