- **`hunt-xss`** / **`hunt-ssrf`** / **`hunt-sqli`** / **`hunt-ssti`** / **`hunt-idor`** — When a hunter is actively testing a parameter and needs payloads. Workflow primitive: this skill is the payload library those hunt-* skills reach for; the hunt-* skill identifies the sink, this skill provides the syntax.
- **`triage-validation`** — When deciding if a finding is reportable at all. Workflow primitive: the "Always Rejected" and "Conditionally Valid — Requires Chain" tables in both skills must agree; `triage-validation` runs the 7-Question Gate, this skill provides the chain-required mapping used by Q7.
- **`web2-recon`** — When the URL set has been classified by `gf` patterns. Workflow primitive: `gf xss/ssrf/sqli` outputs from recon → look up the corresponding payload section here; `gf` pattern names index directly into this skill's payload sections.
- **`evidence-hygiene`** — When a payload produces output worth screenshotting. Workflow primitive: after a payload demonstrates impact (cookie theft, data exfil), hand off to `evidence-hygiene` for redaction before the screenshot becomes evidence.
- **`bb-methodology`** — When Phase 3 (Discovery) routes by input type. Workflow primitive: Phase 3's decision flow ("ID param → IDOR checklist", "URL input → SSRF checklist") names which section of this arsenal to load.
