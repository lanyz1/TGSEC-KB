## Rust/Blockchain Source Code (Hard-Won Lessons)

**Panic paths: encoding vs decoding** -- `.unwrap()` on an encoding path is NOT attacker-triggerable. Only panics on deserialization/decoding of network input are exploitable.

**"Known TODO" is not a mitigation** -- A comment like `// Votes are not signed for now` doesn't mean safe.

**Pattern-based hunting from confirmed findings** -- If `verify_signed_vote` is broken, check `verify_signed_proposal` and `verify_commit_signature`.

```bash
# Rust dangerous patterns (network-facing)
grep -rn "\.unwrap()\|\.expect(" --include="*.rs" | grep -v "test\|encode\|to_bytes\|serialize"
grep -rn "if let Ok\|let _ =" --include="*.rs" | grep -i "verify\|sign\|cert\|auth"
grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME\|not signed\|not verified\|for now" --include="*.rs" | grep -i "sign\|verify\|cert\|auth"
```
