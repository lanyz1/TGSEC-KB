## Duende BFF — Token-Confusion & Session-Fixation (2024-2026 surface)

Duende BFF deployments expose two distinct auth-bypass families beyond the CSRF angle covered in `hunt-csrf`. Both are documented architectural realities, not unicorn CVEs.

### Attack class 1 — YARP `UserOrClient` / `UserOrNone` privilege escalation

`Duende.BFF.Yarp` attaches access tokens to proxied routes via `WithAccessToken(TokenType.X)` metadata. The **misconfig pattern**: developer marks a route `UserOrClient` (use user token if logged in, else fall back to *client-credentials* token) intending it for a "public catalog" endpoint. The client-credentials (M2M) token frequently has broader scope (`api.admin`, `internal.read`) than any user token. An **unauthenticated** attacker hitting that route gets the request proxied with the **service-account token attached** to the downstream API — privilege escalation by design when the downstream trusts the bearer.

**Payload shape:** identify a BFF route marked `TokenType.UserOrClient` (visible via 401-vs-200 differential when no session, or via leaked OpenAPI/NSwag spec). Hit it with no cookies → BFF forwards with M2M token granting admin-scope downstream. ([docs.duendesoftware.com/bff/fundamentals/apis/yarp](https://docs.duendesoftware.com/bff/fundamentals/apis/yarp/))

**Adjacent confirmed CVE:** **CVE-2024-51987** in `Duende.AccessTokenManagement.OpenIdConnect` — *"HTTP client uses incorrect token after refresh"* — materially the same family of token-confusion at the proxy layer. Moderate severity, fixed 2024. ([GHSA-...51987](https://github.com/advisories?query=duende))

### Attack class 2 — Cookie-domain wildcard + sliding expiration = persistent ATO

When BFF session cookie has `Domain=.example.com` (devs do this to share login across `app.` and `admin.`), the `__Host-` prefix protection is dropped. Any sibling subdomain — including a **taken-over** one (`legacy.example.com` CNAMEd to deprovisioned Heroku/S3) — can write `Set-Cookie: .AspNetCore.Cookies=<attacker_session>; Domain=.example.com`. Victim hits `app.example.com` carrying the attacker's session = **session-fixation ATO**.

If `SlidingExpiration=true` (default) and `ExpireTimeSpan` is large (e.g. 8h), an exfiltrated cookie remains valid and keeps sliding forward as long as the attacker periodically calls `/bff/user`. There is no server-side refresh-token rotation check on the cookie itself — only the OIDC token (server-side) rotates. Persistent ATO window per stolen cookie.

**Payload shape:** subdomain takeover → write the BFF session cookie with `Domain=.example.com` → victim's next visit to `app.example.com` adopts attacker's session. Cron-curl `GET /bff/user -H 'X-CSRF: 1' -b '.AspNetCore.Cookies=...'` every 6h indefinitely to keep the session alive.

### Attack class 3 — `/bff/user` claim disclosure

`GET /bff/user` returns the **full claim set** of the active session as a JSON array — `sub`, `sid`, `email`, `bff:session_expires_in`, `bff:session_state`, `bff:logout_url`, plus every custom claim the OP issued (department, role, internal employee ID, tenant ID). The endpoint is gated only by session cookie + `X-CSRF: 1`. If `AnonymousSessionResponse=Response200` is set, the endpoint also acts as a session probe (200 + claims vs 200 + `null`) usable as an auth-state oracle. Low/Medium info-disclosure on its own; valuable as recon for the YARP token-confusion class above.

### Evidence strength + reporting tip

No Duende.BFF-direct CVE exists. The three classes are exploitable via real-world misconfigurations; CVE-2024-51987 and CVE-2025-26620 in the adjacent `Duende.AccessTokenManagement` packages make token-confusion a confirmed family. **Report by chain impact** (e.g., "low-priv session reaches admin-scope downstream API via UserOrClient route" → Critical) rather than by CVE citation, since the issue is design-level.

Cross-references for the chain:
- `hunt-csrf` — the role-partitioned antiforgery class (the CSRF angle on the same BFF surface).
- `hunt-subdomain-takeover` / `hunt-subdomain` — required primitive for the cookie-domain attack.
