## Function-Level Access Control (Broken Authorization)

Authentication bypass gets you *in*; **function-level access control** failures let an already-authenticated low-privilege user reach privileged *functions* the UI never offered them. This is the authorization sibling of `hunt-idor` (object-level access) — test both whenever you hold any authenticated session.

**The sibling-function rule:** if 9 endpoints under a path enforce auth/role middleware, the 10th that doesn't is your bug. Admin route families are the highest-yield place to look:

```
/api/admin/users   → has auth middleware
/api/admin/export  → often MISSING it
/api/admin/delete  → often MISSING it
/api/admin/reset   → often MISSING it
```

**Anti-patterns to grep for:**
```javascript
// Missing middleware on a sibling route
router.get('/admin/users',  authenticate, authorize('admin'), getUsers);
router.get('/admin/export', getExport);            // No middleware!

// Client-side role check only — server never re-checks
if (user.role === 'admin') showAdminButton();      // frontend gate
app.post('/api/admin/delete', deleteUser);         // no server-side check
```

**How to hunt:** enumerate every privileged endpoint (admin/export/delete/reset/impersonate, GraphQL admin queries), then replay each from a *regular* authenticated session — and again with no session. A 200 (or a differential vs the 403 its siblings return) is broken function-level access control.

**Real paid example — HackerOne TrustHub:** `POST /graphql` with the `TrustHubQuery` operation had no authorization check — a regular user could read all vendors' data (CVSS 8.7, High). The object-level variant (e.g. a WebSocket `get_history` accepting an arbitrary UUID with no ownership check) belongs to `hunt-idor`.
