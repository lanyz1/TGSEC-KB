## Real Impact Examples

**Scenario 1 — SSO Enforcement Bypassed via Forgotten Protocol Endpoint**
A large ride-sharing company enforced SSO (via OneLogin) on all WordPress-based internal/public properties. The XMLRPC endpoint (`/xmlrpc.php`) remained active and accepted WordPress-native credentials entirely independent of the SSO flow. An attacker with any valid WP-native credentials (obtained via credential stuffing or from a previous breach) could authenticate directly through XMLRPC, bypassing MFA, SSO policies, and IP restrictions enforced on the main login form. Impact: Full authenticated access to all WordPress functions available to that user role, including content management and potentially admin functions.

**Scenario 2 — SAML Assertion Forgery via Signature Validation Failure**
A major enterprise communication platform's SAML SP implementation failed to properly validate assertion signatures in specific edge cases. By manipulating the XML structure of a captured SAMLResponse (specifically through comment injection or namespace prefix attacks), an attacker could modify the `NameID` value to impersonate any user in an organization — including workspace administrators — without possessing that user's credentials or private key material. Impact: Complete account takeover of any user within a SAML-enabled organization; attacker gains access to all messages, files, and integrations in the workspace.

**Scenario 3 — Cross-Portal Privilege Escalation via Shared Auth Backend**
An e-commerce platform's partner/reseller portal issued authentication tokens that were validated by the same backend service as the merchant admin portal. A partner-level account (lower trust, external-facing) could use its issued credentials or tokens to authenticate directly against admin-tier API endpoints, bypassing the merchant onboarding and permission assignment flow. Impact: A malicious partner could access any merchant's admin panel, modify store configurations, exfiltrate customer PII and payment data, or install malicious scripts — affecting thousands of merchant storefronts.
