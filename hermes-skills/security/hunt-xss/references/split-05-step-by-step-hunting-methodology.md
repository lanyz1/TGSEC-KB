## Step-by-Step Hunting Methodology

1. **Map all reflection points** — Spider the target and identify every place user input appears in HTML output. Prioritize URL parameters, form fields, path segments, unique markers, HTTP headers (User-Agent, Referer), file upload names/contents, and API response fields rendered in the UI.

2. **Classify by type** — Determine if each reflection is reflected (URL parameter → response), stored (database → later rendering), or DOM-based (JavaScript reads URL/storage → DOM sink). Each requires different delivery and context-aware analysis.

3. **Probe sanitizer behavior** — Send harmless canary strings first: `aaa"bbb'ccc<ddd` to determine which characters are escaped. Observe if output is in HTML context, attribute context, JS context, or URL context.

   **Marker Discipline:** When choosing canary strings, they MUST be unique random alphanumeric strings (8+ chars, no English words, no protocol keywords). Bad markers: `test`, `marker`, `evil`, `attacker`, `payload`, `javascript`, `script`. Good markers: `cpmark987abc`, `x4hd2k9pq`, `__ZZ_MARKER_<random>_ZZ__`. Before claiming reflection, search the baseline (no-marker) response for the marker — if it appears naturally in the page (e.g., the word `javascript` is in every page's help-link hrefs), it's a false-positive trap and you need a different marker. This single check catches 80% of false-positive reflection reports.

4. **Test allowlisted tag combinations** — If a sanitizer is in use, probe for dangerous tag combos: `<math>+<style>`, `<svg>+<style>`, `<iframe srcdoc>`, `<style>` with expressions.

5. **Hunt SVG and file upload vectors** — Upload SVG files containing `<script>` tags. Check Content-Type response header. Test if CSP applies to SVG responses separately.

6. **Test markdown/documentation renderers** — In wiki, README, or doc fields, try: `[text](javascript:alert(1))`, inline HTML injection, Kroki/Mermaid payloads, RDoc `link:javascript:` syntax.

7. **Check redirect parameters** — Test `?redirect=javascript:alert(1)` and `?return_url=//evil.com` — look for single-click XSS via improper redirect sanitization.

8. **Probe UTM and analytics parameters** — `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign` are often reflected without sanitization on marketing pages.

9. **Test CSP bypass opportunities** — If CSP is present, look for: JSONP endpoints on allowed domains, `unsafe-inline` in style-src, SVG that bypasses script-src, script gadgets on whitelisted CDNs.

10. **Attempt stored XSS in profile/metadata fields** — Username, bio, tag names, label colors, organization names — these render in many contexts and often have weaker validation.

11. **Check cache poisoning** — Test if reflected XSS payloads can be cached and served to other users (especially on CDN-fronted pages), transforming reflected XSS into stored-equivalent.

12. **Validate in target browser** — Always confirm in a real browser before reporting. Many payloads echo back in Burp but fail to execute in a real browser due to CSP, output encoding, framework auto-escaping, context mismatch, WAF normalization, or browser HTML-parsing differences. (Note: Chrome's XSS Auditor was removed in Chrome 78 / Oct 2019 and no shipping browser has one — never attribute a failed PoC to an "XSS auditor".)
