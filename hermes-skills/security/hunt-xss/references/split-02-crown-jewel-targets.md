## Crown Jewel Targets

XSS is high-value when it combines **privileged context + persistent delivery + scope escalation**. The highest payouts come from:

- **Admin panels and authenticated dashboards** (e.g., `*/admin`, `*/settings`) — attacker can hijack sessions with elevated privileges, exfiltrate tokens, or pivot to account takeover
- **Payment/financial flows** (`paypal.com`, checkout pages, currency converters) — XSS here enables credential harvesting and financial fraud at scale
- **Stored XSS in collaborative features** (wikis, markdown renderers, issue trackers, RDoc, labels, tags) — one payload infects every viewer, multiplying impact
- **SSO/signin pages** (e.g., `paypal.com/signin`) — XSS here is critical because it can steal auth tokens across the entire platform
- **Shared SaaS tenant surfaces** (`*.[SHOPIFY_STORE]`, `api.collabs.*`) — XSS in one tenant's context can bleed across tenant boundaries
- **Help/documentation sites** (`help.shopify.com`) — lower severity individually, but often have looser sanitization and trusted user perception
- **SVG/file upload endpoints** — frequently bypasses CSP and sanitization simultaneously

**Asset types that pay most:** Main product domains > Admin subdomains > API endpoints > Marketing/help sites
