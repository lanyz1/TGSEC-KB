## Common Root Causes

1. **Trusting `html_safe` in Rails** — Developers mark strings as safe after partial sanitization, or chain `.html_safe` on user-supplied data without full sanitization.

2. **Allowlist sanitizers with dangerous tag combinations** — Allowing `style` alongside `math` or `svg` creates mXSS (mutation XSS) opportunities even when individual tags seem harmless.

3. **Third-party rendering pipelines** — Markdown-to-HTML pipelines (Banzai, Kramdown, Kroki) introduce XSS when diagram/rendering engines aren't sandboxed and output isn't re-sanitized.

4. **Reflecting URL parameters without encoding** — UTM params, redirect URLs, and search terms are reflected in page HTML or JS without proper HTML-encoding, especially on marketing/help pages that are treated as lower-security.

5. **SVG treated as non-script content** — Developers apply CSP to HTML responses but forget that `image/svg+xml` responses can execute JavaScript and often aren't covered by the same CSP header.

6. **Incomplete sanitizer patches** — CVE-patched sanitizers are bypassed by slight variations (e.g., CVE-2022-32209's incomplete fix demonstrates that sanitizer logic is difficult to get right, creating bypass chains).

7. **`javascript:` scheme not blocked in href/src** — Link renderers (RDoc, Markdown) fail to block `javascript:` URLs in href attributes, treating them as valid external links.

8. **Cache layers storing authenticated user input** — CDN or reverse proxy caches store responses containing user-controlled XSS payloads, serving them to subsequent unauthenticated users.

9. **File upload without Content-Type enforcement** — Accepting SVG or HTML files and serving them without forcing `Content-Disposition: attachment` or overriding Content-Type.

10. **Translation helper XSS** — Rails `translate`/`t()` helper marks translation strings as HTML-safe and interpolates user input, enabling injection through locale keys.
